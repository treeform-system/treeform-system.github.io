The following pages are meant to be a general overview of the internals in RootDB.

RootDB is currently in development and therefore the documentation surrounding it is bound to change and evolve over time. So why am I writing all this? Having a proper documentation for the decisions made for all the structures under the hood is a good thing to have to look back on and think through the issues RootDB is aiming to solve, as well as being helpful for those curious what kind of stuff RootDB is capable of or those developing their own databases. The actual implementation will be on the [Github](https://github.com/treeform-system/rootdb). 

The following pages assume some knowledge of computer science and therefore talks about concepts a beginner might not understand, they are not beginner friendly documentation and are not intended to be friendly, there goal is to merely detail what makes up this database or some interesting decisions made.
